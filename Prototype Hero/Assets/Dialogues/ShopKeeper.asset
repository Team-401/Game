  - "Hmmm, welcome\u2026 You appear to be a prototype, but I think you'll do just
    fine..."
  - There's a dark wizard in the woods outside of town, he's well guarded by men
    and magic alike.
  - "In order to get him and prove yourself, you'll need all your skills\u2026 that
    and my magic amulet."
  - What's that? Did you think I'd give it to you for free? HA! Not a chance.
  - You need to go out into the wild and get me gold.
  - With enough gold you might be able to buy some extra goods to help you on your
    quest.
  - Oh, and if you see a statue in the woods, beware.
  - It's the necromancer's guardian, and it's magic will hold you back.
  - Unless you have a magic charm, that is...
  - Please, go buy from my shop so I can go to the casino!
  - ... I've been wanting to play Craps for weeks, just need more coin...
  - "If you'd like I'd be happy to educate you on all things \"craps\" related...\r"
  - The fundamental bet in craps is the Pass line bet.
  - It is a bet for the shooter to win!
  - You have to go? Oh... well come back soon!
